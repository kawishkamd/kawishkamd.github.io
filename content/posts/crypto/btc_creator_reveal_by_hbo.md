So, there's a new HBO documentary dropping soon called Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery, 
and it's all about the elusive creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.
This show, directed by Cullen Hoback & will air on October 8th on HBO.

The documentary claims it might finally unmask Satoshi, 
whoâ€™s believed to control a staggering 1.1 million Bitcoins, 
worth around **$66 billion**. 
This has been a hot topic for over 15 years, 
with many people claiming to be him but never providing solid proof.

Honestly, Iâ€™m not convinced this documentary will actually reveal Satoshiâ€™s identity. 
I think this can't do shit to the market at all, despite what a lot of people are saying. 
But hey, weâ€™ll just have to wait and see! ðŸ˜ºðŸ’–

Interestingly, there's some bettings going on [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) where people can wager on who they think Satoshi is. 
Right now, [Len Sassaman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Sassaman) is leading the bets, but other names like Hal Finney are also getting some attention.
